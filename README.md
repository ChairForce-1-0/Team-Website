# Welcome to Our GitHub Organization!
>>>>>>> main

### 1. Joining the Organization

If you haven't been added yet, please let the admin know your GitHub username so they can send you an invitation to join the organization.

### 2. Teams and Roles

Our organization is structured into various teams, each with specific roles and responsibilities. 

- **Developers**: Responsible for writing and committing code.
- **Reviewers**: In charge of code reviews and merging pull requests.
- **Project Managers**: Oversee project progress and ensure milestones are met.

Find out which team you're part of and familiarize yourself with your roles.

### 3. Repositories

Projects are organized into repositories. Make sure you:

- Only push code to repositories you have been given access to.
- Follow the naming conventions and folder structure of the repository.

### 4. Workflow

Our organization uses the following GitHub flow for managing changes:

1. **Branch**: Always create a branch when working on new features or bug fixes. Branch names should be descriptive and start with your initials, followed by a short description of the feature or fix (e.g., `JD-AddLoginButton`).

2. **Commit**: Write clear, concise commit messages. Each commit should represent a logical change. Use the imperative mood in your commit messages (e.g., "Add readme file", not "Added readme file").

3. **Pull Request (PR)**: When you've finished your work on a branch, create a PR against the `main` or `dev` branch. The PR should summarize the changes made and any other relevant information (e.g., "Fixes bug #123").

4. **Review**: At least one other team member should review and approve the PR before it is merged. This ensures code quality and reduces errors.

5. **Merge**: Once approved, the PR can be merged into the main branch. Make sure to keep the commit history clean and understandable.

### 5. Communication

- **Issues**: Use GitHub issues to track bugs, enhancements, or other tasks. Keep the discussion in issues focused and informative.
- **Comments**: Leave thoughtful comments on commits, pull requests, and in discussions to provide context and feedback.

### 6. Best Practices

- Keep the `main` branch stable. All development work should be done in branches.
- Update and pull from `main` frequently to keep your local copy up to date.
- Test your changes thoroughly before pushing them.

## Conclusion

We are excited to have you as part of our team and look forward to seeing your contributions. Remember, open communication and collaboration are key to our success. If you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask other team members for help.

Let's build something great together!
